MODIFICATIONS: Halved EC2 performance of application servers; conventional storage of EC2 instances, which might reduce user experience. Reduced on the DB-side to db.m5.large instances.
RATIONALE: I am optimistically assuming that the lower budget is due to more careful planning of our application, i.e. we are projecting less traffic in the initial phase. Hence, lesser performant EC2 instances and DB-servers will still handle the traffic.
